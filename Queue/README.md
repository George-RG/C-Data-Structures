# QUEUE

__The queue is a linear data type that follows the LILO (Last In Last Out) operation order.__ 

Two basic operations:
1. Enqueue : Adds an item at the start of the queue
2. Dequeue : Removes and returns the last item of the queue

## Performance
Algorithm  | Average case | Worst case
---------- | -------      | ----------
Enqueue	   | O(1)	      | O(1)
Dequeue    | O(1)	      | O(1)
