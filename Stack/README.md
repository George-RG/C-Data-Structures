# STACK

__The stack is a linear data type that follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) operation order.__ 

Two basic operations:
1. Push : Adds an item at the top of the stack
2. Pop : Removes and returns the top item of the stack

## Performance
Algorithm  | Average case | Worst case
---------- | -------      | ----------
Push	   | O(1)	      | O(1)
Pop 	   | O(1)	      | O(1)
